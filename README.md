# ODEv2
Public release of the ODEv2 metamodel

What you find in this repository
================================

In this repository you find the metamodel as ecore files. In the beginning, for each ODE package a metamodel file has been created namely:
* architecture.ecore
* base.ecore
* dependability.ecore
* failureLogic.ecore
* SACM.ecore

For the latest ['ODE_ToolAdapter'](https://github.com/DEIS-Project-EU/DDI-Scripting-Tools/tree/master/ODE_Tooladapter) version, these metamodel files for each ODE package have to been merged into a single file. 
Thus, if you want to use the common tooladapter, please use the merged ODE metamodel file **mergedODE.ecore**.
